> Project: 1
>> Increment or Decrement Counter

    Here I learn useState Hook 

> Project 2
>> Reuseable card component

    Here, I learned how to create and use reusable components. Also, learn to pass data through props, then learn to destructure the props and use the data.
    In this project, we use Tailwind CSS for styling.

> Project 3
>> Bg Changer

    Using useState, I am changing the background color on the button click.

> Project 4
>> Random password generator

    This is a random password generator app. Here, I learn how to use the useCallback hook to optimize the code, the useRef hook to get the reference of an element, and the useEffect hook for initial loading. The useEffect hook takes a parameter; whenever the parameters change the state, it automatically rerenders the function.

> Project 5
>> Currency converter app
