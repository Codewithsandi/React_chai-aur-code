# Chai aur React | Sandipan Kundu

> Project: 1
>> Increment or Decrement Counter

    Here I learn useState Hook 

> Project 2
>> Reuseable card component

    Here, I learned how to create and use reusable components. Also, learn to pass data through props, then learn to destructure the props and use the data.
    In this project, we use Tailwind CSS for styling.

> Project 3
>> Bg Changer

    Using useState, I am changing the background color on the button click.
